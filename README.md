.The feature_1 in the task represent the age of the students

. feature 2 represent the effect of education of parents on failures.

.feature 3 represents time spent with family in free time on a rating of 1-5.           

Now for level-2:

2)for travel time  i used mean

3)for Fedu I used mean 

4)for higher i used mode

5)for freetime i used mode

6)for absences i used mean 

7)for G2 i used mean

8)for Feature_1 i used mode 

9)for Feature_2 i used mode

10)for Feature_3 i used mode 

Level-3:

1)schoolsup Vs G3

2)G3 Vs Dalc

3)Internet acess Vs G3

4)Feature_1 Vs Romatic

5)G3 Vs famrel

Level-4:

I made a prediction mode for romantic for 3 different  data.
                                                                            1)academic behaviour
                                                                            2)school and study related
                                                                            3)life style


For each prediction I used 3 classification techniques(used classification because the output will be either yes or no)
                                   1)Logistic Regression
                                   2)Decision Tree 
                                   3)Random Forest


and also i ahve plotted SHAP plots for each classifier in each prediction
