.The feature_1 in the task represent the age of the students

Justification:the mean of feature_1 is nearly 17(16.74) and the mean and the mode both are 17 and most data lies between 15 and 17.So,the feature_1 represents age of 
              students(most probably).

.The feature_2 and feature_3 are rating based because the values lie between 1 and 5.so it is something based on opinion or a review on something kind of.I guess the feature_2 is the opinion on school life on rating of 1-below average,2-average,3-good,4-excellent.
