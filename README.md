.The feature_1 in the task represent the age of the students

Justification:the mean of feature_1 is nearly 17(16.74) and the mean and the mode both are 17 and most data lies between 15 and 17.So,the feature_1 represents age of 
              students(most probably).

.The feature_2 and feature_3 are rating based because the values lie between 1 and 5.so it is something based on opinion or a review on something kind of.

The max value of feature 2 is 4 and i plotted heat maps with those whose maximum rating values are 4 i.e Medu,Fedu,traveltime,failure.The results show that most of the feature 2 like most of the feature 2 is lying for Medu or Fedu greater than 2 and failures less than 2.

Now for level-2:There are a total of 10 coloumns with empty values.

1)famsize i have used mode for the famsize because the entries are strings and another reason is i thought mostly there will be a famsize greater than 3(father,mother,2 son's).

2)for travel time  i used mean.The mode came out to be 1 and the mean came out to be 2(nearly).I thought 30 min is ok to travel from school to home. 

3)for Fedu i used mean 

4)for higher i used mode.Since the one with no data will do what most students do.

5)for freetime i used mode most people have the same free time after school.

6)for absences i used mean because the mode came out to be zero,the mean came out to be around 4.As we dontt have data we can not use mode since it is zero so i have used mean.

7)for G2 i used mean.The missed grade will ne filled with average grade since the mode of the grades slightly depends on prof.

8)for Feature_1 i used mode beacuse it its age and most of the students will be of same age i.e mode of the data.

9)for Feature_2 i used mode as it is voting based i went to most voted.

10)for Feature_3 i used mode as it is voting based i went to most voted.

Level-3:

1)schoolsup Vs G3:the results show that most students who are taking schoolsup are getting grades same as most students who are not taking schoolsup.

2)G3 Vs Dalc:The results show that those students whose Dalc is more than 3 are getting grades mostly less than 12.

3)Internet acess Vs G3:The results show that percentage of people for a given grade is almost same for those having internet acess and those not having internet acess.

4)Feature_1 Vs Romatic:The results show that the students with age 16 and 17 are not likely to have a romantic relationship(mostly).

5)G3 Vs famrel:The results show that irrespective of famrel moste people are getting same grades in around 10.
